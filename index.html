          <p>
            Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and attract
            more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored
            on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought.
            I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but
            the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.
